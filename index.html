  <h1> REFLECTIONS ON STAGE '0'</h1>
<h2> Understanding HTML</h2>
<P> Although the web includes <em> URLs, HTTP, web applications , <B>HTML</B></em></em> is the main type of content on the web.
The World Wide Web is a collection of HTML files. HTML stands for<em> hypertext mark-up language.</em>
There are around 30 billion HTMLs on the web, built up since the 
invention of the internet in the '90s.'
</P>
<h2> How it all comes together</h2>
<p> How the internet works, from the time one opens a browser, 
  typing information into a Google search bar, to the time information is diplayed is 
  a complex process involving four maor concepts namely;<br>
  <b> 1. The Internet:</b> The largest computer network.<br>
  <b> 2. The HTTP:</b> The main protocol governing how the web functions. <br>
  <b> 3. Servers:</b> These are computers hsoting files making up the web<br>
  <b> 4. Browsers:</b>Programs that display files on the computer, such as Firefox, Chrome and Internet Explorer 

</p>

<h2> The web communication path</h2>
<p> The user enters information into a <b> browser </b>which in 
turns sends the files to the <b> Internet</b>. The internet in 
turn communicates with <b> HTTP Protocol</b>which in turn sends 
the files to the servers and the process starts again in reverse. 
In this way, the browser is able to display the requested 
information on the computer </p>

<h2> The HTML Mark-up</h2>
<p> An HTML mark-up has three major components; <b> an opening tag, a content
  and a closing tag.</b> HTML tags include a <b> bold tag</b>,<em> an emphasis tag</em>
  <b> image tag</b>, and a <em> paragraph tag</em>. Documents can also be written bt
  adding <em> links</em> in what is known as <b> an anchor tag.</b> An anchor tag is different
  from other tags as it contains an 'href' sign at the beginning of the tag.</p>

  <h3> Inline and Blocks</h3>

  <p> Inline tags are tags that uses lines only. These include the, 
    <em> break, bold, image and emphasis, span and strong tags. </em>
    The block is a tag that uses invisible lines to contain a text.
    A good example is the <b>paragraph tag.</b>
  </p>

  <h3> Span and Div</h3>

  <p> Span and div are normal HTML elements. The difference
  is that span is an <b> inline </b>element while a div is a <b> block</b> element.</p>
